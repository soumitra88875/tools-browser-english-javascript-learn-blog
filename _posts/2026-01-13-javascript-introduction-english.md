# ⚡ JavaScript — The brain of websites

Imagine —  
A person who looks good  
but cannot move,  
cannot speak,  
and cannot respond.

That is exactly how a website is if **JavaScript does not exist**.

HTML gives structure  
CSS gives design  
but **JavaScript gives life** 🧠

## 📜 The birth of JavaScript

In 1995,  
a company called **Netscape**  
wanted to make websites more interactive.

A programmer named **Brendan Eich**  
created a language in just **10 days**.

The name of this language was —  
> **JavaScript**

So that people would not fear it and feel excited to learn it.

## 🤔 Why is JavaScript needed?

Imagine you build a door (HTML),  
paint it beautifully (CSS),  
but it cannot open.

JavaScript adds the **handle**.

Without JavaScript —
- Buttons won’t work  
- Forms won’t submit  
- Popups won’t open  
- Data won’t load

## 🌍 How is a website without JavaScript?

Without JavaScript —
- Facebook won’t scroll  
- YouTube won’t play videos  
- Login won’t work  
- Nothing will respond  

It becomes just a **poster, not an app**.
