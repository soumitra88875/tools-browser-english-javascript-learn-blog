## 🛡️ Extra Important: Image Hide ≠ Data Save  
*(Must Read for Low-Data Users)*

If you only hide images using scripts—  
Image loading data may already be consumed.

So, to **truly save data**,  
this extra step is **mandatory** ✅  

⚠️ This feature is available only on  
**Tools Browser v1.15 or higher**

---

## 🔧 Mandatory Step to Save Data  
*(Completely Stop Image Loading)*

1️⃣ Open Tools Browser  
2️⃣ Settings → **Site Settings**  
3️⃣ Scroll down  
4️⃣ Find **Image Load** option  
5️⃣ **Uncheck** it ❌

✔ No background data usage  
✔ Only text will be readable  
✔ Safe reading even with low data  

📌 Whether image hide scripts exist or not—  
👉 **Not a single drop of data will be used for images**
